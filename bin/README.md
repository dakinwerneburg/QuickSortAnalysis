# QuickSortAnalysis
Investigates the various optimization techniques of Quicksort

This was an accumulation of two projects from CMSC 350 (Data Structures and Analysis) at Universy of Maryland University College in which we had to implement quicksort, and then using various other sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Insertion sort once the number of elements what small enough.  The goal was to see if this approach actually performed better than just running Quicksort for the entire collection.
